## How to use mkdocs

* Make sure to create ci.yml file under the .github/workflows
* You have to configure pages under the settings of the repository. Publishing source branch should be selected as gh-pages. The gh-pages branch will be created automatically by the ci during the deployment.
* If you set the repo name as <username>.github.io then you can just start using the following domain name: username.github.io
